Title: gsmr2 - a tool for causal inference between complex traits
Description: GSMR2 (Generalised Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomisation v2) is an improved version of GSMR, which uses GWAS summary statistics to test for a putative causal association between two phenotypes (e.g., a modifiable risk factor and a disease) based on a multi-SNP model. This version implements a global heterogeneity test to remove invalid instrumental variables and provides a causal estimation that is more robust to directional pleiotropy.
